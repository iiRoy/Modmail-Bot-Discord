This is a modmail for discord. It was built using Discord.js version 13.0.1. Please remember to give credits if you're using my code for any purposes. Thanks for looking at it. I am just starting programming, and I appreciate any healthy rehearsal. This modmail is quite incomplete, since I never found a way to get the free hosting of Replit to work in a long way, however you can use it as a temporary solution while you look for others to help you.
